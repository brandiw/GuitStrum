# GuitStrum

Over the weekend I planned out my project. The initial state of everything prior to working with the UX team can be seen below.

## Wireframes, Routes, and Database Planning:

These are the initial routes I for this project:

These are the intial wireframes for the pages.  They include all user navigable buttons and general layouts of the page.

This is the intial structure for the database.  There are still a few possible changes I may make, but at the moment, this is the plan.
